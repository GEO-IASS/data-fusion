# data-fusion
This repository contains the MATLAB library implementing the data fusion algorithm on a computational example and experimental cross-sections of developing embryos. It is associated to the article "Synthesizing developmental trajectories by data fusion", Villoutreix P., And√©n J., et al., 2017.

The code is written in Matlab. The datasets can be found at this URL. 

The code uses the ScatNet library implementing the Scattering Transformation which can be obtained at this adress http://www.di.ens.fr/data/software/scatnet/ .

Some of the scripts used have been published previously:
