# data-fusion
This repository contains the MATLAB library implementing the data fusion algorithm on a computational example and experimental cross-sections of developing fly embryos. It is associated to the article "Synthesizing developmental trajectories by data fusion", Villoutreix P., And√©n J., et al., 2017.

The code is written in Matlab. The datasets can be found at: https://github.com/paulvill/data-fusion-images .

The code uses the ScatNet toolbox implementing the Scattering Transformation, all the necessary scripts are stored in the folder scatnet-0.2. More details can be found at this adress http://www.di.ens.fr/data/software/scatnet/ .

Some of the scripts used have been published previously:
- Lim, Bomyi, et al. "Dynamics of inductive ERK signaling in the Drosophila embryo." Current Biology 25.13 (2015): 1784-1790.
    Scripts are stored in the folder LDL15.
- Dsilva, Carmeline J., et al. "Temporal ordering and registration of images in studies of developmental dynamics." Development 142.9 (2015): 1717-1724.
    Scripts are stored in the folder DLL15.
- Lederman, Roy R., and Ronen Talmon. "Common manifold learning using alternating-diffusion."  Tech. Report YALEU/DCS/TR-1497 (2014).
    Scripts are stored in the folder LT14.

To initialize the paths, first run `addpath_datafusion`. The images can then be downloaded automatically by running `download_data'.
The main scripts are found in the `examples` folder and consist of:
- spiral_example.m : implements the data fusion algorithm on a non-linear 1-dimensional trajectory in a 3-dimensional space, knicknamed "spiral".
- spiral_example_cross_validation.m : implements the K-fold cross-validation on the "spiral".
- experimental_dataset.m : implements the data fusion on the experimental datasets leading to a multimodal movie containing the spatio-temporal dynamics of 5 chemical species on top of morphological changes.
- experimental_dataset_cross_validation.m : implements the K-fold cross validation on the "experimental datasets".
